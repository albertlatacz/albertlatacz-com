    I started looking into functional programming probably about two years ago and one of the tools that came in
    handy while I was learning it was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">
    Read-Eval-Print-Loop</a> (aka. REPL). The REPL is an interactive console that allows evaluating language
    expressions and printing results on the fly. Most of the functional languages have one but since Java didn't really
    touch on that ground just yet it doesn't have one. There are several alternatives but I've decided to write one as
    well. Here's the result:

    The web version is available at <a href="http://www.javarepl.com">www.javarepl.com</a> and you can check out the code
    at <a href="https://github.com/albertlatacz/java-repl">GitHub</a>. Also you can have a look at
    <a href="http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/?pluginId=7215">IntelliJ plugin</a> and
    <a href="http://albertlatacz.published.s3.amazonaws.com/javarepl/javarepl.jar">console</a> versions.
